# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

For the third section this project, I'll add a form for booking a table at the coffeeshop. It will showcase the creation of HTML forms along with the art of styling them using CSS.

For the final stage of the project, Iâ€™ll make some organizational changes to the file structure and finish off the final two sections of the webpage; menu and about the coffee shop.

## Further improvement of the project Aug 15th 2023

For the Contact section, I plan to add a feature that triggers the default email client to open when the user clicks on the link.
